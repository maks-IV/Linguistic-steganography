# Linguistic-steganography
This project demonstrates demonstrates the work of the latest linguistic steganography algorithm - Parallel Encryption with Cover Text (PECT) ASP .NET Core 3.1.4 + Bootstrap 4.5
# Research
The objective of this research is to secure our information from unauthorized users therefore hacker,
cracker in IoT environment. Our main aim is to hide our plain text so that it cannot be
figured out with intrusive eyes with some encryption method. The two encryption techniques
that are currently used are Cryptography and Steganography. Both the approaches
are different from each other. Steganography is hiding our whole secret message under
a message known as cover message whereas Cryptography is hiding of our contents of
the secret message using either symmetric or asymmetric encryption method. Therefore
in Steganography, the presence of our secret message is hidden i.e. only the sender and
receiver are aware of its presence and can retrieve it whereas in Cryptography it is not,
third party is aware of the presence of secret message.
